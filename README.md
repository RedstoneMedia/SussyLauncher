A very simple mod launcher/loader for the game Among Us (Also referred to as A̷͙ͭͫ̕ḿ̬̏ͤͅo̯̱̊͊͢ĝ̽̓̀͑ư̡͕̭̇s̠҉͍͊ͅ ඞ). 😩💦

This Project is written with the Rust programming language 🚀 and the tauri framework 🚀. \
The use of the rust Programming language is import because of its zero cost abstractions 🚀🚀❌💱💹💰. \
This means the Launcher is blazing fast 🚀💨 and is Memory safe 🚀🔒💾.

It uses svelte for the frontend 💻, which is obviously the best web framework/compiler 👍. \
Apart from using Rust 🚀 with WebAssembly 🌐🔨.

Download it [here](https://github.com/RedstoneMedia/SussyLauncher/releases) 🔽 \
Either use the installer, or just open the exe (This will create new files at the exe location ‼😲)

# Contributions
Everyone is welcome to contribute to this. (Why would you want to, though ?) \
I will accept every pull request, that doesn't:
- Completely break everything 😲💥
- Contain the word "Go" 🤡 or "Golang" 🤡 anywhere, including the code <- Completely Unacceptable 🚫🙅‍♂️😳
- Overcomplicated the App. (This Launcher is supposed to be relatively simple and intuitive) 🥶
- States that anything happened on the 5th April 1976, at Tiananmen Square 🚷❓❌🈲㊙🙈

# Build
If you want to build this yourself, you will need to [install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) the Rust programming language 🚀.
This includes the Rust's 🚀 package manager cargo 🚀, which is superior to any other package manager 💯.

Then you need to install the tauri cli like this: 🔽 \
`cargo install tauri-cli --version ^1.0.0-beta`

Then you only need to run `npm install` and after that you can already start building. 👨‍💻

For these next steps to work, you might have to [install](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section) WebView2 😶 first.

To run it in dev mode, you can run `cargo tauri dev`. \
If you want to build it, just run `cargo tauri build`. \
The build output then is in `src-tauri/target/release` (Also contains the installers in `/bundle`) 🆗
